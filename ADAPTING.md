# Adapting an existing solution to Cloud Events

`EXTENDING.md` covers building a message type from nothing. This covers the more common
case: you already have a working extension, and you want some of its existing procedures
callable through Cloud Events **without rewriting them**.

The worked example is `Legacy App` + `Legacy App - Cloud Events` in this repo. `Legacy App`
is written as if Cloud Events didn't exist - two procedures, two different shapes on
purpose. `Legacy App - Cloud Events` depends on it and wraps both. Read them in that order;
this document explains the *why* behind what you'll see.

## The two apps, and why there are two

`Legacy App - Cloud Events` depends on `Legacy App`, not the other way around, and it never
modifies `Legacy App`'s objects directly. That split matters for a real retrofit: you often
don't own, can't touch, or don't want to touch the original extension's release cycle
(someone else's module, a customer's, a different team's). Keeping the adapter as a
separate, additive extension means the original app's behaviour for its existing callers -
pages, other codeunits, whatever already calls it - never changes.

## Case 1: `Legacy.Stock.Reserve` - a thin wrapper, nothing else needed

`Legacy Stock Mgt.ReserveStock` has no dialogs and no intermediate `Commit()` - the whole
operation is one transaction, and it can't leave anything half-done. `Legacy Stock Reserve
Impl.ExecuteCloudEventTask` calls it directly: parse the JSON, call the procedure, write the
JSON response. No change to `Legacy App` was needed. **This is the case people assume is the
only case** - it's why a "just wrap it" mental model survives until it hits case 2.

## Case 2: `Legacy.Stock.CancelReservation` - the one that needed a real change

The original `CancelReservation` has two problems that a thin wrapper cannot paper over:

1. **It asks a question.** `Confirm('Cancel the reservation for %1?', ...)` has no answer
   from an automated caller. Depending on BC's confirm-handling context, this either throws,
   silently defaults, or hangs - none of which is what you want from an unattended message
   type.
2. **It commits too early.** The original deleted the reservation, called `Commit()`, and
   *then* wrote the cancellation log. If that second write ever failed, the deletion had
   already stuck - there is nothing to roll back. That's invisible in interactive use
   (a user watching the screen doesn't experience "partial failure" the same way), and a
   real bug in unattended use, where nothing is watching and a retry could double-log or
   mask the fact that the first attempt half-completed.

**You cannot fix either problem from the adapter app.** Both are inside `Legacy App`'s own
procedure. The fix, in the second commit that added `Legacy App - Cloud Events`, was one
targeted extraction:

- `CancelReservationSilent(ItemNo)` — the same two writes, no `Confirm()`, no `Commit()`
  between them. Added to `Legacy Stock Mgt` in `Legacy App`.
- `CancelReservation(ItemNo)` — kept, unchanged in behaviour for existing callers, now just
  the confirm dialog in front of the silent core.

`Legacy Cancel Reserve Impl` calls `CancelReservationSilent`, never the original. Existing
callers of `CancelReservation` (pages, whatever already used it) don't need to change at
all - the extraction is additive, not a rename.

## How to tell which case you're in

Before wrapping an existing procedure, check it for:

| Signal | What it means |
|---|---|
| `Confirm()`, `Message()`, or any page/dialog call | Needs a silent variant extracted first - an automated caller can't answer it |
| `Commit()` anywhere before the procedure returns | Needs a silent variant extracted first - a mid-procedure commit breaks the isolated-failure contract every message type relies on (see `EXTENDING.md` §5) |
| Plain data read/write, no UI, one transaction | Safe to wrap directly, as in case 1 |

If neither signal is present, you're almost always in case 1. If either is present, you're
in case 2, and the fix is the same shape every time: extract a silent core, keep the
original as a thin wrapper around it, point the adapter at the silent core.

## What doesn't change between building fresh and retrofitting

Everything in `EXTENDING.md` §2-§5 still applies exactly as written: six interface methods,
enum registration, the two guards, the error-handling split, the write-isolation rule. A
retrofit's impl codeunit is not a different shape - it just calls into an existing
procedure (or a newly-extracted silent one) instead of writing new logic from scratch.

## What's different

- **Object ID range**: use the *existing* solution's own registered range for the adapter's
  new objects - never register a fresh one, unlike a from-scratch extension.
- **Help text is new work regardless.** The original procedure's XML doc (if it has one)
  describes an AL signature. `GetMessageHelpAsMarkdownDocument` has to describe the JSON
  wire contract instead - that's unwritten before the retrofit, every time.
- **Tests are new work regardless.** Existing tests call the procedure directly with typed
  parameters. Nothing exercises the JSON-in/JSON-out path or its error cases until you write
  it for the adapter.
